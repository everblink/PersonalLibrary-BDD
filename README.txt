This is a quick project to utilise the skills/knowledge learnt from going through tutorials using SpecFlow.

This project is to create a simple database type application that stores information about what DVDs/Games/Blu-rays I have in my library.

Should allow the user to add/remove/edit only when they have registered and logged into the site.
